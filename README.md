# the-PC-shop
This shop will allow customers to buy from one of two main categories: custom builds (a computer that is built and customized to meet specific customer needs) and pre-built machines (complete systems assembled by well-known manufacturers using balanced hardware configurations). You currently only carry a relatively small (but powerful) inventory of items, but you want to give your customers the best experience possible anyways. You will be writing a program (using Python) that allows users to order items from your shop.
In this assignment, you will get practice with:
- Creating functions
- Calling functions and using returned values
- User input in a loop
- Conditionals
- Lists, 2-D lists, and tuples
- String formatting for clean output
